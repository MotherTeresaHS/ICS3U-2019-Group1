==========

In this project we used a series of 16 pixels by 16 pixels picture to act as our characters, enemies and such. All we did was make a 16x256 file and inserted the  sprites along the picture and then uploaded to the pybadge.

    :alt: Image Bank for Shooter Shootout

Next we continued to use the sprite and find a way to move it around, and this was how we did it.
